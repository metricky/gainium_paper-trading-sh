# Changelog  
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.  
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.11] - 2026-09-08
### Added
- `PAPER_FEE_ASSET_SYMBOLS` (comma-separated) reports the listed symbols' fee as paid in a third asset (`PAPER_FEE_ASSET`, default `GNM`) instead of split onto `feeSide: base | quote` — for testing the platform's BNB/BGB/KCS-style discount-asset path without a real account that has one. The charged amount and wallet debit are unchanged; only the reported asset changes. Spec 004. Supersedes an earlier, unshipped `PAPER_ZERO_FEE_SYMBOLS` attempt at the same underlying need — a confirmed-zero fee has nowhere to land in the observed-fee contract (`hasObservedFee`/`observedFeeSplit` both gate on `amount > 0`, by design) and TP-quantity sizing never reads a fee amount for anything besides the third-asset check, so forcing 0% never could have changed TP sizing. The third-asset path is real, observed, and already the exact gate (`ordersFeeIsThirdAssetOnly`, spec 014/015) that skips the TP gross-up.

## [1.3.10] - 2026-09-08
### Fixed
- `UserGateway.sendOrderToClient`'s socket.io `order` push now carries `feePaid`/`feeSide`, the same fields `paperOrderFee` has reported on the REST endpoints since 1.3.8. That push feeds main-app's live order-update stream — the path TP placement actually runs on — and every one of its 5 call sites had been passing the raw order (`fee`/`feePerc` only) instead. Fixed at the one place all five funnel through, so a filled paper order's fee now reaches main-app on both paths a real exchange's fee does. Spec 003; companion fixes in `websocket-connector-sh` (spec 004) and `main-app-sh` (spec 017) are required for the fee to actually reach main-app.

## [1.3.9] - 2026-09-03
### Added
- CI now runs a real `npm test` (mocha) on every PR. `fees.spec.ts` was
  previously a standalone ts-node script with no test runner — converted
  to real mocha `describe`/`it`.

## [1.3.8] - 2026-08-27
### Added
- **The simulated fee is now reported on the order**, as `feePaid` + `feeSide` on `CommonOrder`, keeping this service in lockstep with exchange-connector core 1.20.8, where every venue now records the fee it actually charged. The simulator has always CHARGED a fee — `order.fee`, accrued across partial fills and debited from the paper wallet — and never reported one, so a paper deal's cost reached main-app only as a `qty * price * rate` estimate. Reporting the number the simulation actually took lets the consumer treat the paper and live paths identically. `feeAsset` and `feeBreakdown` are declared for contract parity but unused here: the simulator always charges in one side of the pair.
- `feeSide` restates, in one place, the rule the simulator already applies when it debits the wallet — inverse futures settle in the base coin, linear futures in the quote coin, and spot takes the fee out of the asset RECEIVED (base on a buy, quote on a sell). Covered by a standalone ts-node check (`src/order/fees.spec.ts`; this repo has no test runner), written against the debit each code path performs so the two cannot drift apart silently.
- A zero fee is reported as NO fee rather than `feePaid: '0'`, matching the live connectors: an absent fee means "keep your estimate", and a `0` would teach a consumer that the fill was free.

## [1.3.7] - 2026-08-24
### Security
- `GET /user/verify` is rate limited. It answers "are these credentials valid?" as a clean boolean, with plaintext secrets behind it and no lockout anywhere, so guessing was unbounded (GHSA-5xf3-v5jf-jwrc). Default 30 requests per minute per source, which sits far above the legitimate caller — main-app verifying a paper connection — and far below a brute-force rate. Tune with `VERIFY_RATE_LIMIT` and `VERIFY_RATE_WINDOW_MS`. The limiter is deliberately dependency-free and bounds its own key table, so it cannot itself be turned into a memory-exhaustion vector.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-08-21
### Security
- The listen interface is configurable via `APP_HOST`. The default is unchanged — all interfaces, the exact `listen(port)` call this service has always made — because under Docker this runs as its own container and the api/connector containers reach it over the compose network. A deployment where every client shares one host can now set `APP_HOST=127.0.0.1` and take the service off the network entirely, which is worth doing wherever that network exposure is not needed.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-08-21
### Security
- A wallet top-up with a non-finite amount is rejected instead of corrupting the balance. The guard was a bare `amount < 0`, and `NaN < 0` is false, so `NaN` slipped past it and `$inc` wrote the wallet's free balance to `NaN`. Reported as GHSA-5xf3-v5jf-jwrc.
- Order lookups no longer return another tenant's order out of the in-memory cache. `GET /order` and `GET /order/{id}` authenticated the caller and then read a process-global cache keyed only by `(symbol, externalId)` or by order id — with no ownership check — returning that hit before the user-scoped database query ever ran. A cached order now goes only to its owner; anything else falls through to the query, which was already correctly scoped. Reported as GHSA-5xf3-v5jf-jwrc.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-08-18
### Security
- Authentication now rejects non-string API credentials before they reach the database. `key` and `secret` are declared `string`, but that type is erased at runtime and the service installs no global `ValidationPipe`, so an object supplied in a query string or JSON body was forwarded into the Mongoose filter as MongoDB query operators — turning the exact-match credential lookup in `getUserByKeyAndSecretOrThrow` into a predicate that matched an arbitrary account. Since every authenticated entry point (user, order, and the WebSocket gateway) converges on that one method, this bypassed authentication for all of them. Reported as GHSA-8p69-9fjc-6g78.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-08-05
### Fixed
- Paper futures: a liquidation now closes the position that was actually liquidated. The close re-derived its target from `(user, positionSide)`, so when a user held several same-side positions on one symbol every liquidation resolved to whichever came first — one closed, the rest stayed `NEW` with an untouched `positionAmt` and were re-liquidated on every following tick without end.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-29
### Fixed
- `updateBalances` no longer spams `TypeError ... reading 'quoteAsset'` for orders/positions on delisted or expired symbols: `getExchangeInfo` now throws instead of returning an undefined `data` when a symbol can't be resolved, and the reconciliation loops skip unresolvable instruments quietly.
### Added
- Daily orphan sweep (`sweepOrphanPositions`): closes stale `NEW` futures positions (idle >180d) whose symbol no longer resolves — dead instruments that could never close on their own and had accumulated since 2023.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-29
